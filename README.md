## üìà Projects

Here are a few projects I've worked on that showcase my expertise:

- **[Private Label Recommendation System](https://github.com/chalika-vanyaa/StartupCampus-Final_Project/tree/main)**: Developed a **recommendation system** in a team capstone project to boost private label brand sales in marts.
  Using data analysis and machine learning, we tailored recommendations to enhance private label sales and suggest frequently co-purchased items.
  This project was the final capstone for the **Independent Study Program**: **Startup Campus Batch 6 - DSAI Track**.
- **[Housing Price Prediction](https://github.com/chalika-vanyaa/StartupCampus-Assignment)**: Created regression models to predict housing prices based on a Kaggle competition dataset.
  This assignment focused on feature engineering and model optimization to enhance price prediction accuracy. This project was part of my coursework for **Startup Campus Batch 6 - DSAI Track**.
