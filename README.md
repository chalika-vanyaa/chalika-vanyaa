## üìà Projects

Here are a few projects I've worked on that showcase my expertise:
- **[Credit Risk Prediction Model](https://github.com/chalika-vanyaa/Credit_Risk_Prediction_Model)**: Developed and implemented three classification models‚Äî**Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest Classifier**, and **XGBoost** to predict **loan credit risk**, based on borrowers' financial history and credit behavior.
  This project was the final capstone for the **Rakamin Academy x ID/X Partners - Virtual Based Internship Program**.
- **[Brain MRI Tumor Image Classification](https://github.com/chalika-vanyaa/Brain_Tumor_MRI_Image_Classification_Project)**: Developed a **Convolutional Neural Network** (CNN) model to **classify brain MRI tumors** into four categories: No Tumor, Glioma, Pituitary, and Meningioma. The model achieved an **accuracy of ~91% without using pre-trained models**.
  This is the second project in the **IDCamp x Dicoding - Belajar Pengembangan Machine Learning Intermediate Level Program**
- **[Halodoc Sentiment Analysis Project](https://github.com/chalika-vanyaa/Halodoc_Sentiment_Analysis_Project)**: Conducted a **sentiment analysis project** by scraping review data from **Halodoc** and testing multiple classification models, including **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **Na√Øve Bayes**, **KNN**, **SVM**, and **Recurrent Neural Network** (RNN). 
  This is the first project in the **IDCamp x Dicoding - Belajar Pengembangan Machine Learning Intermediate Level Program** and was developed for **educational purposes** only.
- **[Private Label Recommendation System](https://github.com/chalika-vanyaa/StartupCampus-Final_Project/tree/main)**: Developed a **recommendation system** in a team capstone project to boost private label brand sales in marts.
  Using data analysis and machine learning, we tailored recommendations to enhance private label sales and suggest frequently co-purchased items.
  This project was the final capstone for the **Independent Study Program**: **Startup Campus Batch 6 - DSAI Track**.
